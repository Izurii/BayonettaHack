# BayonettaHack

I'm using Visual Studio 2015 but almost work with Studio 2017. When calling the function "FindPattern" you need to put a cast to "char pointer" (char*) on the mask. Example: "FindPattern(startAddress, 6000, (PBYTE)"\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55", +(char*)+"xxxxxx");

Just inject the dll and use the functions keys to active the cheats.
